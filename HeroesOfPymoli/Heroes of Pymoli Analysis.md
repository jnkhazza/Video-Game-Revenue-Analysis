After thoroughly analyzing the data, I came to three conclusions about Heroes of Pymoli. The first one is that players ages 20-24 make up the largest demographic (almost 45%) of players of the game. This can help with determining where to focus marketing efforts to maximize the user base and in-game purchases. Second, the overwhelming majority (~84%) of the players are Male. Looking at this, the company can decide to either focus on its Male base, or start to think about how to get new Female players interested in the game. And lastly, the “Final Critic” is the most profitable and popular item in the game. Again, the company has a decision to make about continuing to leverage the popularity of the “Final Critic” item to continue selling it at a high rate, or to focus on driving up revenue on other items. All in all, we learned a lot of useful information about Heroes of Pymoli after dissecting the data.
